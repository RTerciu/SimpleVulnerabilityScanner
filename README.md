# SimpleVulnerabilityScanner
Main interface for the scanner

<h2>ReadMe Page</h2>
<p>This is a Web Based App build with ASP.MVC and HTML Agility Pack package.</p>

<p>The starting point of the application is the ScanController, the Index method, which process the following URL
 http://ip:port/Scan/[Index]</p>

<p>Data is taken from the form, such as an URL , which is checked to be an absolute URL, and cookie data that can be used in the proccess of scannig.</p>

<p>Vulnerable parameters are scanned in the following places ( Models/Scanner.cs , StartScan method).<br>

	There are three types of injection point to be searched:
    <ul>
        <li>The Url provided</li>
        <li>Form data</li>
        <li>Anchors ( "a" tags)</li>
    </ul>
	If such a point is found, it is added tot the Injection Points lists.
    Injection Points that come from form, are marked with Origin=1, and the ones that come frome anchors are marked with Origin=2 </p>

<p> After finding all injection point, we must scan for three types of vulnerabilities: OS Command, SqlInjection, File Inclusion<br />
    To check wheter an injection point is a vulnerability, there are 2 scenarios:
    <ul>
        <li>the parameter comes from a form</li>
        <li>the parameter comes from an anchor</li>
    </ul>
	
	In the first case, we build a HTTP Request, having forms method (POST/GET), and with one parameter set with the proper value for each type of injection.
	However, the rest of parameters belonging to the form must be added to the request. Therefore, in the request will be added parameter with Origin=1 and
	value corespunding to the one they had when the page was parsed or a default one (the name of the parameter is also the value)
    In primul caz, voi construi un request cu metoda formului (Post,GET), cu parametrul setat cu valoarea potrivita pentru fiecare tip de injectie,

    In the second case, we will build requests only with the specified parameter to avoid interefering with the other functionalities. (e.g. To avoid infinit loops errors )
    
	If the responses from such requests, contain strings that mark the presence of the vulnerability, we will add this point to the list of
	scan results
 <xmp>(List<ScanResult>) </xmp>
    </p>

<p>The Last step in the application is to render the data in the View.</p>
<p>Examples can be found in PrintScreens folder.</p>
