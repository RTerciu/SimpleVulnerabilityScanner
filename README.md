# SimpleVulnerabilityScanner


<p>This is a Web Based App built with ASP.MVC and HTML Agility Pack package.</p>

<p>The starting point of the application is the ScanController (Index method), which process the following URL
 http://ip:port/Scan/[Index]</p>

<p>Data is taken from the form, containing fields such as an URL , which is checked to be an absolute URL, and cookie data that can be used in the proccess of scannig.</p>

<p>Vulnerable parameters are scanned in the following places ( Models/Scanner.cs , StartScan method).<br>

	There are three types of injection point to be searched:
    <ul>
        <li>The Url provided</li>
        <li>Form data</li>
        <li>Anchors ( "a" tags)</li>
    </ul>
	If such a point is found, it is added tot the Injection Points lists.
    Injection Points that come from forms, are marked with Origin=1, and the ones that come from 	 anchors are marked with Origin=2 </p>

<p> After finding all injection points, we must scan for three types of vulnerabilities: OS Command, SqlInjection, File Inclusion<br />
    To check wheter an injection point is a vulnerability, there are 2 scenarios:
    <ul>
        <li>the parameter comes from a form</li>
        <li>the parameter comes from an anchor</li>
    </ul>
	
	In the first case, we build a HTTP Request, using original forms' method (POST/GET) and one parameter set with the proper value for each type of injection.
	However, the rest of parameters belonging to the form must be added to the request. Therefore, in the request will be added all parameters with Origin=1 having
	values coresponding to the ones they had when the page was parsed or default ones (e.g: the name of the parameter is also the value)

    In the second case, we will build requests only with the specified parameter to avoid interefering with the other functionalities. (e.g. To avoid infinit loops errors )
    
	If the responses from such requests, contain strings that mark the presence of the vulnerability, we will add this point to the list of
	scan results.
 <xmp>(List<ScanResult>) </xmp>
    </p>

<p>The Last step in the application is to render the data in the View.</p>
<p>Examples can be found in PrintScreens folder.</p>
